# rcawpastea vps.txt

* Daily regimen for meditation.  It contains a "keep the hits" argument, meditation for meditators, preparation for mind reading, clears security fears from meditators, gives each meditator 50 As with a custom algorithm, invites each meditator to a spiritual psychiatrist every month, and expands thoughts from `Text-to-Breasonings/luciansphilosophy.txt` for each meditator.  This last step should only be taken when original philosophy has been written.

* Follow the instructions for human daily regimen at <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt">Daily Regimen (and safety instructions for using Text to Breasonings)</a>.
* Modify the meditators in `Text-to-Breasonings/rcawpastea\ vps.txt`, `Text-to-Breasonings/mindreadtestshared.pl` and `Text-to-Breasonings/meditatorsanddoctors.pl`.
