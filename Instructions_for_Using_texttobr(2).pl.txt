Instructions for Using texttobr(2).pl

Use the computer as an extension of yourself to breason out texts.



Glossary: Breasoning is thinking of the x, y and z measurements in metres of an object in a sentence.



1. Perform the following Daily Regimen, containing meditation, pedagogy and medicine preparation.


Meditation - (this is what the Setting up a VPS with TextToBr.txt simulates).


You can naturally prevent a headache by silently repeating the mantra, "lucian" for twenty, minutes, twice per day. The mantra becomes lighter and lighter, until one forgets the thought, clearing the mind.  Also, silently repeat the sutra "green" for twenty minutes, twice per day after two months of using the mantra in the morning and evening.  Also, pray for no digestive system pops from practising the sutra each day.

Quantum Box and Nut and Bolt


Quantum Box


The quantum box is a guided meditation that I will describe later that prevents headaches, (relaxes head and neck muscles), and prevents muscle aches and pains.  In it, you can make anything (e.g. a headache) instantly disappear, based on quantum physics (where at the quantum level, things may disappear if we want them to).


Nut and Bolt


The nut and bolt is a guided meditation that is a more detailed prevention of problems the Quantum Box prevents.  In it, pretend to unscrew a nut from a long thin bolt each day to prevent a headache, etc.


One-off

One-off: Repeat Upasana * 800 and breason out the following 7 breasonings details to God.  I make a small recommendation of a University accredited short Education course every two years or a degree every ten years.



Repeat Upasana * 800 if not done in a chain of meditation days linked to today (and green, Purusha, Use, Teacher, Maharishi, Doctor each x 800 before Upasana if they are not done in a chain of meditation days linked to today).

Breason out (think of examples with objects that you have thought of the x, y and z dimensions of) the following 7 breasonings details as an exercise. Pretend to breason out the breasonings details to God.

See http://lucianspedagogy.blogspot.com.au/p/writing-sentences-by-making.html

1. Details - As an exercise, think of two uses, a future use and two types for each object.

2. Breasoning - Think of the x, y, z dimensions and colour of each object.

3. Rebreasoning - Think of the fact that the person and the object in a sentence are connected by a verb (an action) that means they touch.

4. Breathsoning - Think of a reason that the object is judged good (a judgment adjective).

5. Rebreathsoning - Think of a reason that the verb (action) is judged done well (a judgment adverb).

6. Space - Think of spatial characteristics of the person in relation to the object (room, part of room e.g. table and direction in room e.g. plate).

7. Time - Think of temporal characteristics of the person in relation to the object (time to prepare e.g. buy, time to do e.g. eat, and time to finish e.g. place core in a receptacle).




Daily Regimen


I recommend Yoga and Qi Gong.

Too (just say “too” for each idea following to indicate the two radio buttons)

2. One-off, breason out 250 characters from Lecturer Training, to be able to breason out anything you want, not just found out breasonings.


“Lecturer (all in this document)


    1.    I collected the comments.

“Recordings from 30 As 1

“Too”: 5 symbolic strawberries (each is 0.01, 0.01, 0.01 cm) for Recordings to work.


4. Each day, prepare for using texttobr[1/2]:


Realise the hand breasoning switch is done for you each day from the first time you switch it on, doing the following, by breasoning out the following ten words from file2qb.txt (medicine) each day:
"i the to and in by of this prepared a"


Use only ONE of the following plans.  It is recommended to progress through plans 1-3, for at least one month each.  Commence instructions at 8 AM at the earliest.  Warning: Not following these instructions when using texttobr[1/2] can results in haemorrhoids, eyelid twitches and eyelid itchiness.


Note: In the following, 250 characters/10 words (that you MUST breason out each day before using texttobr[1/2] from Job Medicine are:


“I relaxed my whole body.  I had a bath.  I ran the water.  I stepped into the bath.  I enjoyed the bath.

I played the game.  I massaged myself.  I massaged my neck.  I massaged my shoulders.  I felt good.

I had a hot bath.  I ran the water.  I turned t”


Plan 1:

Every Monday and Thursday:

1. Prepare the radio button: Accredited, at the time, turned off (to make accreditation acceptable) computer science, breathsoned, VET, sales, education for the following.

2. The next step means that you are seen as breasoning out text before texttobr, computer housing the breasonings, 250 breasonings per waking hour for 16 hours, stopping at midnight (from word breasonings first), no medical problems from it.

3. Breason out a radio button (0.01, 0.01, 0.005 cm).

4. Hand-breason out (not use texttobr[1/2] for) 250 characters from Job Medicine.

5. If necessary, download SWI-Prolog for Mac or Windows and install it.


6. Type the following commands in SWI-Prolog:


[texttobr2].


[texttobr].


texttobr2.


texttobr.

(To breason out each character in the file).


Alternative to 6: It is recommended to replace the contents of file.txt with Lecturer Training, Recordings Training and JobMedicine.txt, one-off, and


Type the following commands in SWI-Prolog:

* Note: see T2B_docs.md for instructions about running TextToBreasonings.

Notes:


Replace ⁃, – in file.txt with - or crashes

Replace “,” in file.txt with " or crashes

Replace ‘,’ in file.txt with ' or crashes

Replace MS Word return in file.txt with normal return or crashes

Replace nonbreaking space " " in file.txt with normal space " " or crashes


If there are any invisible characters apart from esc then brdict.txt may become corrupt, and should be replaced with a backup.  You could directly delete the invisible characters from brdict.txt, but Lucian Academy accepts no responsibility for this.


You don't have to reinsert smart quotes in file.txt afterwards because texttobr2 doesn't change the file.  Simply use the copy of your text before you inserted and changed it in file.txt.
