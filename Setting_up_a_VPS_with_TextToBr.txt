Setting up a VPS (Virtual Private Server) with TextToBr

Use a VPS (necessary because of the time the computation takes) to achieve meditation without meditating.  Many daily benefits, such as health.

Please read Instructions for Using texttobr(2).pl.txt before installing.

Note: Instructions are for Mac, but you can modify steps 6 and possibly 9 for Windows and Linux.

Note: Replace /Users/yourname/yourfolder/ (in edit.pl lines 12 and 13 and the following) with the folder the rest of the files will be in, /var/www/yourdomain.com/ (edit.pl line 14 and the following) with the home folder on the VPS and xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (edit.pl line 14 and the following) with your VPS's IP address.

Replace stub meditator and doctor names in meditationnoreplace.pl and medicinenoreplace.pl respectively.  Meditators are taught by Lucian Academy, or a teacher with 50 Meditation As who dots on the utterance-arem link daily and doctors are those who need the effects of medicine.

1. Sign up for a free account on e.g. AwardSpace.com.
2. Sign up for a free or paid domain name inside the AwardSpace control panel.
3. Sign up for a $10/3 months VPS account.
4. Ask the admin to install SWI-Prolog for Linux (e.g. Debian - https://packages.debian.org/stable/swi-prolog)
5. Set up an FTP account on the VPS using the special control panel.
